        <h1>Day in my life ft <em>technology</em></h1>

        <br>



    <div id="center">

        <div id="wakeup">
            <img src="img/alarm1.mp4" alt="scrolling through phone alarms">

            <p> I start my wonderful days by waking up to the angelic sound of my 5-10 alarms, spaced five minutes apart of course! This is where my technology starts for the day. </p>
        </div>


        <div id="weather">
            <img src="img/realweather.png" alt="picture of San Francisco weather">
            

            <p> Right when I wake up I check the weather for the day. This helps me master which outfit I will rock! Is it gonna be a jeans and sweater type day, or a sweatpants and slippers type day?</p>
        </div>


        <div id="class">
            <img src="img/realsched.png" alt="picture of my class schedule- showing 3 classes">

            <p> I go into my USFMobile app and check my class schedule for the day! Gotta make sure I know where I'm going and when I'm going there! Today I have 3 classes, one being a super fun physics lab! #smartypants #scientist </p>
        </div>


        <div id="lightvideo">
            <img src="img/light.mp4" alt="video of me turing on a light">
            
            <p> I now quietly turn on the light to the bathroom as to not wake up my peacefully sleeping roomate. </p>
        </div>


        <div id="teeth">
            <img src="img/teeth.mp4" alt="video of me brushing my teeth">

            <p> Then I use my wonderful sink to brush my teeth. Don't worry the sink is off while I brush my teeth as to not waste water. I make sure to brush my teeth for 2 minutes in my Hannah Montana t-shirt!</p>

        <div id="fridge">
            <img src="img/fridge.MOV" alt="video of me opening the fridge and grabbing a chai">

            <p> I then head on over to the fridge and grab my gourmet leftover chai! Chai is my favorite morning pick me ups because I don't drink coffee. </p>
